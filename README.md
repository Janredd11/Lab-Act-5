# classify_age
I developed a function named classify_age(age) that categorizes a personâ€™s age based on user input. To handle invalid inputs and prevent errors when non-integer values are entered, I used a try-except block. The function uses conditional statements to classify the individual as a Child, Teen, Adult, or Senior depending on their age.
